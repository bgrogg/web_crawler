# The object returned from HTTParty.get is an HTTParty::Response object

# XML responses, based on the Content-Type of the response, so as soon as
# your response comes back itâ€™s ready for you to work with it:

# this is how we request the page we're going to scrape
page = HTTParty.get('https://scottduane.github.io/TopSecretClue')

# this is where we transform our http response into a nokogiri object
parse_page = Nokogiri::HTML(page)
